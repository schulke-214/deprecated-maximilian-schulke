				<h2>Applicable legal bases</h2>

				<p>
					In accordance with Art. 13 DSGVO we inform you about the legal basis of our data
					processing. The following applies to users from the scope of the Basic Data
					Protection Regulation (DSGVO), i.e. the EU and the EEC, unless the legal basis
					is mentioned in the data protection declaration: The legal basis for obtaining
					consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 7 DSGVO; The legal basis for the
					processing for the fulfilment of our services and the implementation of
					contractual measures as well as the answering of inquiries is Art. 6 para. 1
					lit. b DSGVO; The legal basis for the processing for the fulfilment of our legal
					obligations is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO;
				</p>
				<p>
					In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person
					necessitate the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d DSGVO serves
					as the legal basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal basis for the processing necessary for the performance of a task
					carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
					entrusted to the controller is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e DSGVO. The legal basis for
					the processing to safeguard our legitimate interests is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
					DSGVO. The processing of data for purposes other than those for which they were
					collected is governed by the provisions of Art. 6 (4) DSGVO. The processing of
					special categories of data (pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO) is governed by the
					provisions of Art. 9 para. 2 DSGVO.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className='data-privacy__block'>
				<h2>Safety precautions</h2>
				<p>
					We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the
					legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation
					costs and the type, extent, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as
					well as the different probability of occurrence and severity of the risk to the
					rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection
					appropriate to the risk.
				</p>
				<p>
					Measures shall include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity
					and availability of data by controlling physical access to, access to,
					inputting, disclosure, securing and separation of data. In addition, we have
					established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are exercised, that
					data is deleted and that we react to data threats. Furthermore, we take the
					protection of personal data into account as early as the development or
					selection of hardware, software and processes, in accordance with the principle
					of data protection through technology design and through data
					protection-friendly default settings. Cooperation with contract processors,
					joint managers and third parties
				</p>
				<p>
					Insofar as we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract processors,
					jointly responsible persons or third parties) within the scope of our
					processing, transfer them to them or otherwise grant them access to the data,
					this shall only take place on the basis of legal permission (e.g. if a transfer
					of the data to third parties, such as payment service providers, is necessary
					for the fulfilment of the contract), users have consented, a legal obligation
					provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using
					agents, web hosts, etc.).
				</p>
				<p>
					Insofar as we disclose, transmit or otherwise grant access to data to other
					companies of our group of companies, this is done in particular for
					administrative purposes as a legitimate interest and beyond that on a basis
					corresponding to the legal requirements.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div className='data-privacy__block'>
				<h2>Transfers to third countries</h2>
				<p>
					If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the
					European Economic Area (EEA) or the Swiss Confederation) or if this is done in
					the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or transfer of data
					to other persons or companies, this only occurs if it is done to fulfil our
					(pre)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, a legal obligation
					or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to express consent or
					contractually required transfer, we process or allow the data to be processed
					only in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, which
					includes US processors certified under the "Privacy Shield" or on the basis of
					special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard
					protection clauses of the EU Commission, the existence of certifications or
					binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information
					page of the EU Commission).

				<h2>Cookies and right to object to direct advertising</h2>
				<p>
					"Cookies" are small files that are stored on the user's computer. Different data
					can be stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store
					information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or
					after the user's visit to an online service. Temporary cookies, or "session
					cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user
					leaves an online offer and closes his browser. The content of a shopping cart in
					an online shop or a login status, for example, can be stored in such a cookie.
					Cookies are referred to as "permanent" or "persistent" and remain stored even
					after the browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved if users
					visit it after several days. The interests of the users can also be stored in
					such a cookie, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes.
					Third-Party-Cookie" are cookies that are offered by other providers than the
					responsible person who operates the online service (otherwise, if they are only
					their cookies, one speaks of "First-Party Cookies").
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use temporary and permanent cookies and explain this in our privacy
					policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we ask the user to consent to the use of cookies (e.g. in the context of a
					cookie consent), the legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a.
					DSGVO. Otherwise, the personal cookies of the user will be stored according to
					the following explanations within the framework of this data protection
					declaration on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the
					analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer in the sense
					of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f.). DSGVO) or insofar as the use of cookies is necessary
					for the provision of our contract-related services, pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1
					letter b. DSGVO, or if the use of cookies is necessary for the performance of a
					task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, pursuant
					to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e. DSGVO, processed.
				</p>
				<p>
					If users do not wish cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to
					deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser.
					Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. The
					exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online offer.
				</p>
				<p>
					A general objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can be
					raised for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via
					the US website http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU website
					http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be achieved by switching them off in the
					browser settings. Please note that in this case not all functions of this online
					offer can be used.
